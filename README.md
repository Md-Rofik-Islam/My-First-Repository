Hi, my name is Md. Rofik Islam. I am currently studying in Computer Department at Dinajpur Polytechnic Institute. Also, I have been working in web development for the last two years. I'm currently working with WordPress , Wix & Squarespace Website builder.

Now I'm working in a local company. I've done many projects. I take the time to understand customer expectations and I think about how to make my customer satisfied. If you need any help then you can inbox me and discuss. I hope you will get an outstanding output from me. I'll be very happy to assist you.

Thanks for your time!
